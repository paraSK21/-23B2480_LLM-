Project Notes: When Large Language Model Meets Web Dev
Natural Language Processing
Tokenization
Tokenization is the process of breaking down text into smaller units called tokens. These tokens could be words, phrases, or even individual characters, depending on the requirements of the task. Tokenization helps in preparing text for further analysis and processing.

Stemming and Lemmatization
Stemming involves reducing words to their root or base form. It operates by chopping off the end of words using algorithmic rules, which can sometimes result in non-real words. Lemmatization, on the other hand, involves determining the base or dictionary form of a word, considering the context and meaning. It typically involves more complex linguistic rules and provides actual words.

Text Preprocessing
Text preprocessing involves cleaning and preparing text data for NLP tasks. This can include removing stopwords (common words like "and", "the"), handling punctuation, converting text to lowercase, and more. Preprocessing ensures that text is in a consistent format for analysis.

Converting Text to Mathematical Vectors
In NLP, words or entire documents are represented as mathematical vectors for computational purposes. Techniques like Word2Vec convert words into dense vectors, where each word is represented by a vector in a high-dimensional space. These vectors capture semantic relationships between words.

History of Large Language Models
Large language models have evolved significantly over the years. Initially, models like Eliza (1966) provided basic chatbot functionalities. The development continued with systems like Shrdlu (1972) and MYCIN (1976), which demonstrated early AI capabilities in understanding and processing natural language.

In recent years, advancements in computing power and data availability have led to the development of transformer-based models. These models, starting with BERT (2018) and evolving into GPT-3 (2020), have revolutionized NLP tasks by leveraging large-scale neural networks and vast datasets.

Encoder-Decoder Architecture
The encoder-decoder architecture is a framework used in sequence-to-sequence models, particularly for tasks like machine translation and text summarization. The encoder processes the input sequence into a fixed-size context vector, which the decoder uses to generate the output sequence.

Attention Mechanism
The attention mechanism improves the performance of sequence-to-sequence models by allowing them to focus on relevant parts of the input when generating outputs. It assigns different weights to different parts of the input sequence, enabling the model to pay varying levels of attention during the decoding process.

Transformers
Transformers represent a breakthrough in NLP architecture. They use self-attention mechanisms to process input tokens in parallel, making them highly efficient for handling long-range dependencies in text. Models like BERT, GPT, and T5 are based on transformer architectures and have achieved state-of-the-art results across various NLP tasks.

Transfer Learning
Transfer learning involves leveraging pre-trained models to solve new tasks with limited data. Models like GPT-3 and BERT are pre-trained on vast amounts of text data and fine-tuned on specific tasks, allowing them to generalize well and achieve high performance with minimal task-specific training.

Hugging Face Transformers Library
The Hugging Face Transformers library provides an easy-to-use interface for working with transformer-based models in NLP. It offers pre-trained models, including GPT-2, BERT, and DistilBERT, along with tools for fine-tuning on custom datasets. The library simplifies integration of advanced NLP models into applications and research projects.

OpenAI API
The OpenAI API provides access to cutting-edge language models developed by OpenAI, including GPT-3. Developers can integrate these models into their applications to generate human-like text, perform translation, summarization, and more. The API democratizes access to powerful NLP capabilities.

Prompt Engineering
Prompt engineering involves crafting effective input prompts to achieve desired outputs from language models like GPT-3. By providing specific instructions and context, developers can control the behavior and output quality of the model, making it suitable for diverse applications from creative writing to data analysis.
